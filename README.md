CHiP: Configurable Hybrid Parallel Covering Array Constructor

Configuration Spaces

 ...TODO

They indicate that the tuples (o1=0∧o2=1) and (o2=2∧o1=1∧o5=0) are forbidden to be appear in any configurations of computed covering array, i.e., they are invalid tuples.

    Note that one can define other configuration space models with the same format.
    A sample configuration space model as well as a set of configurations space models for benchmarking are provided.

Dependencies

    NVIDIA GPUs Tool uses CUDA programming model. So, without having NVIDIA GPUs and its driver, the code will not work.

How to build

    Currently we do not provide the source code.

How to run

    ... TODO

Note: This is the first release of the tool, so please send any errors that you encounter or suggestions and questions about the tool to hanefimercan@sabanciuniv.edu

The paper about CHiP is currently under review, therefore we can not give more detail how the algorithm work and share the source code of the CHiP for the moment.
